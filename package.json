Data is rendered in a bubble chart that shows each player as a bubble with the size of the bubble corresponding to the player's performance in the stat that is being viewed. Data is sourced from [StatMuse](statmuse.com) and will be available for every team as well as league-wide, from 2022 going all the way back to the founding of the NBA in 1947.",
